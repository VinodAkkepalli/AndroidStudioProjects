    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    B6:A7:51:9C:C5:30:89:C7:DB:01:3D:17:16:0E:22:53:12:69:08:B0

    B6:A7:51:9C:C5:30:89:C7:DB:01:3D:17:16:0E:22:53:12:69:08:B0

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
